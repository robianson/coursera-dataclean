The only script required to perform this analysis is "Run_Analysis.R" in the root directory. This R script reads in data from the UCI HAR Dataset folder and subfolders and writes the text files "data_set.txt" and "summary_data.txt". See file "code book revisions.txt" for details on the contents of the output files.
