 All variables in data_set.txt and summary.txt are identical to their counterparts in the UCI HAR dataset. Please refer to documentation for that dataset for more information.

 The file data_set.txt contains combined data from the following files:
 test/subject_test.txt
 test/X_test.txt
 test/y_test.txt
 train/subject_train.txt
 train/X_train.txt
 train/y_train.txt

 Only the mean and standard deviation variables of each measurement have been included in data_set.txt. The variables "subject" and "activity" represent the data in the "subject" and "y_train/test" files, respectively.

 The file "summary.txt" contains the mean of all variables in data_set.txt for each subject for each activity.
